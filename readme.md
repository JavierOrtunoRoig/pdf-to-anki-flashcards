# PDF-to-Anki Flashcards

## Overview

**PDF-to-Anki Flashcards** is a tool designed to help students, language learners, and educators quickly and easily convert highlighted text from PDFs into Anki flashcards, particularly **cloze deletion cards**. By automating the process of generating flashcards from study materials, this tool can significantly reduce the time required to create decks, allowing users to focus more on their learning.

> [!WARNING]
> The tool has been **tested specifically with Microsoft Edge** highlighters. If you use another PDF viewer, the highlight colors may not be read correctly, which could lead to improper flashcard creation.


## Usage

1. **Prepare Your PDF**:

   - Open your PDF in **Microsoft Edge** (or another compatible viewer that supports color-specific highlighting).
   - **Use color-specific highlights** to determine how the tool will process the text:
     - **Yellow Highlight**: Marks the sentence or phrase that will become the cloze deletion card.
     - **Green Highlight**: Specifies the exact word or phrase within the yellow highlight that will be hidden (the "cloze").
     - **Blue Highlight**: Creates a writing card where the user must write the correct phrase or word, based on the green-highlighted part.

2. **Run the Tool**:

   - Download and open the **.exe** file (for Windows users) or run the Python script if you’re using another platform.
   - The interface will prompt you to select:
     - The **input PDF** file (where you've highlighted the text).
     - The **destination folder** where the `.apkg` Anki deck will be saved.
     - The **name of the output file** (for your generated Anki deck).
   - **Custom Interface**: The tool uses a **dark-themed**, custom-designed interface for the flashcards, giving them a sleek, modern look.

3. **Generate Flashcards**:

   - After selecting your input PDF and setting your output preferences, click the button to generate the Anki flashcards.
   - The tool will create a deck in `.apkg` format, which you can import directly into Anki.

4. **Import to Anki**:

   - Open Anki, go to **File > Import**, and select the `.apkg` file generated by the tool.
   - Once the import is successful, the flashcards will be available in Anki, ready for you to review!

> [!WARNING]
> After importing the cards, **Anki may not show the newly created cards immediately**. If this happens, go to **Tools > Check Database** to force Anki to update and reflect the new cards.

## Motivation

Creating Anki flashcards can be a time-consuming and repetitive process, especially when extracting information from textbooks, articles, or study materials in PDF format. Many students spend hours manually copying and pasting text into Anki. This tool was born from the need to automate this process, streamlining the flashcard creation experience.

The idea is simple: highlight the important information in your PDF, run this tool, and generate a custom deck of Anki flashcards in seconds. Whether you’re preparing for exams, learning a new language, or organizing lecture notes, **PDF-to-Anki Flashcards** helps you stay productive by automating this process.

## Key Features

- **Easy PDF Import**: Select any PDF file, and the tool will extract your highlights automatically.
- **Anki Deck Export**: Generate an `.apkg` Anki deck file, ready to be imported directly into Anki.
- **Cloze Deletion Cards**: Convert your highlights into cloze deletion flashcards, helping you study more efficiently.
- **Optional Notes**: Add additional notes to the back of each card to provide more context or explanations.
- **Simple User Interface**: Built with Tkinter, the tool includes a simple interface for selecting the PDF file, output folder, and naming your deck.
- **Standalone Executable**: The tool is provided as a standalone `.exe` for Windows, requiring no additional dependencies.
- **Custom Dark-Themed Cards**: The flashcards created by the tool come with a **dark theme** and customized design, providing a modern, eye-friendly study experience.

## Benefits

- **Save Time**: No need to manually create flashcards—simply highlight text in your PDF and let the tool do the rest.
- **Study More Efficiently**: Focus on learning and reviewing, not on formatting and data entry.
- **Customize Your Cards**: Choose the parts of the text you want to hide with cloze deletions, and add optional notes to improve retention.
- **Faster Workflow**: Especially useful for learners dealing with large amounts of study material, helping you build Anki decks in seconds rather than hours.
